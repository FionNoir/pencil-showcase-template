Pencil Showcase Template
========================

Export template for interactive prototypes made with [Pencil](http://www.evolus.vn/Pencil/Home.html).

This template produces an HTML version of the prototype where only one page is shown at a time. 
The user is able to click through the links defined in the prototype but no additional additional navegation elements are provided.
This lack of chrome is convenient for using it for usability tests or other situations where we want to simulate the final system.

The template is based on the [GUIPrototypingTemplate](http://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/downloads/detail?name=GUIPrototypingTemplate.zip) created by the Evolus team with GPL license.

How to use
----------

In order to add the template to your Pencil installation:

1. Tools > Manage Export template...
2. Select "install new template" and select the file "pencil-showcase-template.zip"

When exporting a prototype:

1. Document > Export document..
2. Indicate "that you want "Single web page" as output format, the pages to be exported, and "Showxase HTML template" as the template to be used.
3. Select the destination folder and export.
